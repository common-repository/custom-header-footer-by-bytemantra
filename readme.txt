This plugin enables you to add extra custom header and footer content. Content can be any script, html or styles. It does not support any PHP code.

== Description ==

In this plugin you will be given two sections each for header content and footer content. In each section there will be enable/disable feature.
There will also be a setting field 'content priorty'. This field comes in use when other plugins or widgets are also using this type of functionality.
So if want this plugin to render the data after every plugin's/widget's data then put a bigger number like 100 or if you want this plugin to render the data before all plugins
 then you should use a smaller positive number.
